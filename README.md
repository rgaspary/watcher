# The Watcher
A web scrapper app built using express.js, axios, and cheddar based on [this guide](https://dev.to/terieyenike/how-to-build-a-web-scraper-with-nodejs-f6h) from dev.to and then extended.

The final plan is to be able to run this app on a server and monitor changes to a certain page or website, record the content, and notify when changes occur.
